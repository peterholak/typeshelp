Don't use generic `add(a, b)` examples, instead try to create real-world-like examples from many different domains.

weather
users (admin/role/permissions/social graph)
cms (posts/comments/document/etc.)
game (player, vehicle, level)
music (note, instrument, bar, effects, tracks)
smart things (light on/off, socket power usage, temperature, sensors)
fitness tracking (lap time/pulse/steps)

non-domain types:
async stuff (Future, HttpResponse, ...)

DO NOT SKIMP OUT ON THE EXAMPLES. THE EXAMPLES MATTER A FUCKTON. PUT PROPER TIME AND EFFORT INTO THEM, EVEN IF THEY'RE SHORT (EVEN BETTER THAT WAY).
